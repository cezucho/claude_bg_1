# Active Session State

*Last updated: 2026-08-14*

## Current Task

Concept phase complete. One MVP GDD authored and validated by prototype.

**Done:** `/start`, `/brainstorm`, `/setup-engine`, `/map-systems`,
`/prototype initiative-ladder` (3 rounds), `/design-system initiative-ladder`.

**`design/gdd/initiative-ladder.md` is COMPLETE** — 8 required sections plus
Visual/Audio, UI Requirements, Open Questions. Status: Designed, pending an
independent review.

**Both blocking open questions are now CLOSED:**
- Q1 passing survives the Last Word rule (7.7% strategic passing, vs 8.6% before)
- Q1b the "70% first-mover advantage" was two harness bugs, not a design
  property. Retracted. Mirror matches now run 43-50%.

**Next, in recommended order:**
1. `/design-review design/gdd/initiative-ladder.md` — **fresh session only**
2. `/create-architecture` — the prototype produced hard constraints (state
   cloned ~2,000x per AI decision; determinism required)
3. `/design-system` #2 — Champion Data & Stat Model + Ability Definition Schema

## Project

**AUGURY (working title)** — turn-based tactics / MOBA hybrid. One player commands
five drafted champions on a hex map; abilities carry an **initiative** value and
both sides trade down a descending response ladder.

- Phase: **Concept → Systems Design**
- Engine: Godot 4.6, C# (.NET 8+), PC
- Review mode: `lean` (director gates fire only at `/gate-check`)

## Progress

- [x] `/start` — onboarding, review mode set to lean
- [x] `/brainstorm` — `design/gdd/game-concept.md` written
- [x] `/setup-engine` — Godot 4.6 + C# pinned; `CLAUDE.md`, `technical-preferences.md`, `VERSION.md` updated
- [x] `/map-systems` — `design/gdd/systems-index.md` written (33 systems, 21 MVP)
- [ ] `/design-system initiative-ladder` — **next**
- [ ] Remaining 12 design-owned MVP GDDs
- [ ] `/create-architecture` — ADRs for the three architecture-owned systems
- [ ] `/prototype initiative-ladder`

## Key Decisions

- **Initiative ladder**: an ability at initiative N may be answered by any ability
  at initiative ≤ N, from any champion; the ladder descends until someone passes.
- **Round order**: ladder exchange → death check → status resolution. A champion
  taken to ≤0 HP by statuses survives one more round, debuffed, before dying.
- **Molding**: ability use applies permanent in-match stat changes. Champions
  arrive from the draft unfinished.
- **Three phases**: draft → opening phase (one ability per champion, starts on
  cooldown) → tactical combat. ~25 turns, 10–15 minutes.
- **Turn structure**: alternating, not simultaneous — the ladder supplies the
  collision feel that simultaneous commit would have provided.
- **Action Economy merged into the Initiative Ladder GDD** — they define each other.
- **Physics is presentation-only.** Determinism is a pillar requirement and a
  precondition for post-launch async PvP.
- **Tests split**: xUnit for engine-independent simulation, gdUnit4 for engine
  integration. If a sim test needs Godot to run, the architecture has drifted.
- Items and blitz clock deferred to Vertical Slice — validate one economy first.

## Files Written This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `design/gdd/game-concept.md` | Full game concept: pitch, pillars, loop, MVP, scope, risks |
| `design/gdd/systems-index.md` | 33 systems with dependencies, priorities, design order, risks |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Technology stack → Godot 4.6 / C# |
| `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` | Engine, input, naming, budgets, testing, routing |
| `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` | Corrected LLM cutoff (May 2026); 4.6 risk HIGH → MEDIUM |
| `production/review-mode.txt` | `lean` |

## Open Questions

- **Action economy per round** — what limits how many abilities are spent in one
  ladder? Bounds both match length and AI tractability. Settle in prototype.
- Movement's relationship to the ladder — action with initiative, separate phase, or free?
- Equal-initiative exchanges — what prevents ping-pong at initiative 1?
- Negative HP and the dying round — what debuffs apply, can healing rescue?
- Map composition — lanes and minions unresolved (recommendation: cut minions,
  keep lane-shaped corridors plus a jungle).
- Points economy — what awards points, at what rate, to what total.
- Snowball risk — scaling respawns + points race + 15-minute match, with no runway.

## Highest Risks

1. **AI Opponent** — mandatory for ship, hardest technical problem in the project.
2. **Initiative Ladder** — the whole game rests on it; prototype before finalising.
3. **Determinism** — expensive to retrofit, gates PvP permanently.
4. **Molding legibility** — Pillars 1 and 5 collide; drift may read as noise.

## Follow-Ups Noted

- `.claude/docs/coding-standards.md` hardcodes the Godot CI command as
  `godot --headless --script tests/gdunit4_runner.gd`, which assumes GDScript.
  With C# it needs `dotnet test` for the sim plus a gdUnit4 pass. Fix in `/test-setup`.
